# Circle
This Python script calculates the diameter, circumference, and area of a circle based on a given radius. The program continuously prompts the user to input a radius, then computes the required values and displays them. If the input radius is negative, it prompts for a valid value, and if the radius is zero, the program exits with a "Good Bye!" message. The calculations are made using basic geometric formulas.
